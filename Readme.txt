Overview:
This project focuses on detecting potentially malicious URLs using machine-learning techniques. It utilizes a variety of URL features and machine-learning models to classify URLs as either benign or malicious.

Key Components:

Features: Various URL attributes such as domain characteristics, structure, length, and pattern quantification.
Models: Implemented XGBoost for its superior speed and accuracy in comparison to Random Forest and LightGBM.
Web Application: Developed a Flask-based web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user-friendly URL analysis.
Project Structure:

data: Contains datasets used for training and testing the models.
models: Stores trained machine learning models.
src: Source code for feature engineering, model training, and web app development.
web_app: Includes files for the web application interface.
Instructions:

Install required libraries using requirements.txt.
Use train_model.py for training the machine learning models.
Utilize predict.py for making predictions on new URLs.
Run the Flask-based web application using app.py.
Usage:

Train models using the provided datasets or your own data.
Utilize the models for URL classification or integrate them into your security systems.
Deploy the web application for user-friendly URL analysis and classification.
